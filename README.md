# Signature-verification
Signature Verification System (Prototype) is a Flask-based Python app that classifies handwritten signatures as real or fake. It uses digital image processing (grayscale, noise removal, thresholding) and ML/DL models with OpenCV, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn for educational purposes.
